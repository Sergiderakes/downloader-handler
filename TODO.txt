GUI:           + (1)
	+(2) folder1 | ext1 | ext2 ...
	+(2) folder2 | ext3 | ext4 ...

(1) - Add carpet (need a function)
(2) - Add extension to that carpet
Also: dragable extension

The main screen of the gui should have an option to enable/disable execute the program
every time the computer starts, if that is disable it should have a function to
execute the program and handle the main folder (maybe creating a file and the deleting it)

It can have an executable to install the program
